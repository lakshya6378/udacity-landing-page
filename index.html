         <p>Bitcoin (BTC) is a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp">cryptocurrency</a>, a virtual currency designed to act as money and a form of payment outside the control of any one person, group, or entity, thus removing the need for third-party involvement in financial transactions. It is rewarded to blockchain miners for the work done to verify transactions and can be purchased on several exchanges..</p>
         <p><br>Bitcoin was introduced to the public in 2009 by an anonymous developer or group of developers using the name Satoshi Nakamoto.
            <br>
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>It has since become the most well-known cryptocurrency in the world. Its popularity has inspired the development of many other cryptocurrencies. These competitors either attempt to replace it as a payment system or are used as utility or security tokens in other blockchains and emerging financial technologies.</p>

    <h1>Innovation</h1>
    <p>Bitcoin isn't just about sending money. It has many features and opens many possibilities that the community is still exploring. Here are some of the technologies currently being researched, and in some cases, being turned into real products and services. The most interesting uses of Bitcoin are probably still to be discovered.</p>
    <ul class="innovation-criteria">
        <li class="details">
            <span><img src="images/protection.svg"></span>
            <h2>Control against fraud</h2>
            <p>An unprecedented level of security is possible with Bitcoin. The network provides users with protection against most prevalent types of fraud like chargebacks or unwanted charges, and bitcoins are impossible to counterfeit. Users can backup or encrypt their wallets. Hardware wallets make it very difficult to steal or lose money. Bitcoin is designed to allow its users to have complete control over their money.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="details">
            <span><img src="images/globe.svg"></span>
            <h2>Global accessibility</h2>
            <p>With Bitcoin, all payments in the world can be fully interoperable. Bitcoin allows any bank, business or individual to securely send and receive payments anywhere at any time, with or without a bank account. Bitcoin is available in a large number of countries that still remain out of reach for most payment systems due to their own limitations. Bitcoin increases global access to commerce and it can help international trades to flourish.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="details">
            <span><img src="images/cost.svg"></span>
            <h2>Cost efficiency</h2>   
            <p>With the use of cryptography, secure payments are possible without slow and costly middlemen. A Bitcoin transaction can be much cheaper than its alternatives and be completed in a short time. This means Bitcoin holds some potential to become a common way to transfer any currency in the future. Bitcoin could also play a role in reducing poverty in many countries by cutting high transaction fees on workers' salary</p>
        </li>
        <li class="details">
            <span><img src="images/tips.svg"></span>
            <h2>Tips and donations</h2>
            <p>Bitcoin has been a particularly efficient solution for tips and donations. Sending a payment only requires one click and receiving donations can be as simple as displaying a QR code. Donations can be visible for the public, giving increased transparency for non-profit organizations. In cases of emergencies such as natural disasters, Bitcoin donations could contribute to a faster international response.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="details">
            <span><img src="images/crowdfunding.svg"></span>
            <h2>Crowdfunding</h2> 
            <p>Bitcoin can be used to run Kickstarter-like crowdfunding campaigns, in which individuals pledge money to a project that is taken from them only if enough pledges are received to meet the target. Such assurance contracts are processed by the Bitcoin protocol, which prevents a transaction from taking place until all conditions have been met. Learn more about the technology behind crowdfunding.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="details">
            <span><img src="images/several-streams-of-income.svg"></span>
            <h2>Micro payments</h2>
            <p>Imagine listening to Internet radio paid by the second, viewing web pages with a small tip for each ad not shown, or buying bandwidth from a WiFi hotspot by the kilobyte. Bitcoin is efficient enough to make all of these ideas possible. Learn more about the technology behind Bitcoin micropayments or about future upgrades currently being designed and implemented to make micropayments more accessible.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="details">
            <span><img src="images/justice.svg"></span>
            <h2>Dispute mediation</h2>
            <p>Bitcoin can be used to develop innovative dispute mediation services using multiple signatures. Such services could make it possible for a third party to approve or reject a transaction in case of disagreement between the other parties without having control of their money. Since these services would be compatible with any user and merchant using Bitcoin, this would likely lead to free competition and higher quality standards.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="details">
            <span><img src="images/network.svg"></span>
            <h2>Multi-signature accounts</h2>  
            <p>Multiple signatures allow a transaction to be accepted by the network only if a certain number of a defined group of persons agree to sign the transaction. This could be used by a board of directors to prevent any member to spend parts of their treasury without other members' consent. This can also be used by banks to prevent theft by blocking payments above a threshold if the user does not provide additional credentials.</p>
